# cpac-collab

**Refer to: https://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/latest/user/quick and follow along with the QuickStart guide to kick off a test C-PAC run**
- use a raw data subject of your choice (suggest ABCD data or anything from [S3](https://fcp-indi.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#data/Projects/))
- use the fmriprep-options config

**Start [here](https://github.com/tamsinrogers/cpac-collab/issues/1). Create a GH sub-issue with your name (assign yourself), and in it, take note of:**
- anything in the tutorial that is confusing, tricky, or otherwise unclear
- any missing content required to set up the run

Feel free to:
- co-work, collaborate, research, or otherwise ask for help
- DM @ Tamsin Rogers on Slack with C-PAC-specific questions
- *please include a description of any additional steps taken in your notes*
