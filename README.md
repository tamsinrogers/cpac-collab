Refer to: https://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/latest/user/quick and follow along with the QuickStart guide to kick off a test C-PAC run
- use a raw data subject of your choice (suggest ABCD data or anything from [S3](https://fcp-indi.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#data/Projects/)
- use the [fmriprep-options config](https://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/latest/user/pipelines/preconfig#:~:text=via%20ANTs/ITK)-,fmriprep%2Doptions%3A%20fmriprep%2DOptions%20Pipeline,-%C2%B6)

Start [here](https://github.com/tamsinrogers/cpac-collab/issues/1) create a GH sub-issue with your name (assign yourself), and in it, take note of:
- anything in the tutorial that is confusing, tricky, or otherwise unclear
- any missing content required to set up the run

Feel free to:
- co-work, collaborate, research, or otherwise ask for help
- DM @ Tamsin Rogers on Slack with C-PAC-specific questions
