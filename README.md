# cpac-collab

**Refer to: [the original C-PAC QuickStart guide](https://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/latest/user/quick) and follow along to kick off a test C-PAC run**
- use a raw data subject of your choice (suggest ABCD data or anything from [S3](https://fcp-indi.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#data/Projects/))
- use the [fmriprep-options config](https://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/latest/user/pipelines/preconfig)
- run on an HCP or locally, but cancel the job once it starts so we don't blow up any allocations :)
- if you have never used C-PAC before, focus on [downloading the Docker/Singularity image](https://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/latest/user/quick#:~:text=for%20those%20packages.-,Download%20/%20Upgrade%20C%2DPAC%20with%20cpac,-%C2%B6) as a first step

**Start [here](https://github.com/tamsinrogers/cpac-collab/issues/1). Create a GH sub-issue with your name (assign yourself), and in it, take note of:**
- anything in the tutorial that is confusing, tricky, or otherwise unclear
- any missing content required to set up the run, or additional steps you took

**Feel free to:**
- co-work, collaborate, research, or otherwise ask for help
- reference the [updated C-PAC documentation](https://fcp-indi.github.io/cpac-docs/index.html) (in progress)
- DM @ Tamsin Rogers on Slack with C-PAC-specific questions
- *please include a description of any additional steps taken in your notes*
